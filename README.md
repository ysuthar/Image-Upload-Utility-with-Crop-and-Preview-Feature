## Description 

Hi! Let me give a short description of about these Web Panel Feature. I have made these Utility to allow the user first choose an Image for upload. The Required Image size is fixed at **1024x1024** in **px**. As soon as the image is uploaded a short preview of 4 Images will be shown, these 4 Images are Initially cropped from the center out of the real Images and they will have the following dimensions. 

**Note:** All Dimensions are in pixels.


**1. Horizontal : 755 x 450	<br/>
2. Vertical : 365 x 450<br/>
3. Horizontal small : 365 x 212<br/>
4. Gallery : 380 x 380**<br/>

The User can browse these previews individually and decide on cropping (resizing as well as adjusting) them in an editor mode with small preview on right side that shows what the Image is going to look when saved. The User changes are saved and reflected on the Main page previews.

Finally, the user can upload the Images to a cloud hosting service. After the upload the user can see the images with information about its dimension and a link to view the Image's actual dimensions.
